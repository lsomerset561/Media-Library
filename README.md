This purpose of this project is to practice adding features existing code.

The origin of this project is from Treehouse's Build a Basic PHP Website.  It is a tutorial that results in a personal media library.  I committed along the way to get practice with version control and completed the course 3/15/16.

After 3/15/16, changes to the projects will be to add features and enhancements that are of original thought.  While completing the tutorial, I put comments in the code for enhancements & features.

Feel free to suggest changes or issues.
